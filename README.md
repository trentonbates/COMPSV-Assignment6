# Team Management Tree

You've joined the internal tools team at a growing tech company. The leadership team wants an interactive tool to visualize how employees report to one another. Some employees manage others, and some only report to a single manager. The company wants a structure that can grow as the team scales.

Instead of using a flat list or table, you're tasked with building a **custom binary tree** that represents this hierarchy. Each employee can have up to two direct reports, and youâ€™ll need to build this system using recursive insertion and traversal.

Your program should run in the terminal and allow users to:

- Add a root team lead (CEO or equivalent)
- Add new employees under a specific manager (left or right)
- Print the current reporting structure as a tree

This assignment builds your understanding of **binary trees**, recursive insertion, and tree traversal. These skills are foundational not just for technical interviews, but also for modeling complex, real-world relationships like file systems, routing hierarchies, and decision paths.

## Classes

### `EmployeeNode` Class
Represents a single employee in the tree.

**Constructor**

```python
EmployeeNode(name)
```

**Attributes**
- `name` (str): The employee's name.
- `left` (`EmployeeNode` or `None`): Points to the employee's left report.
- `right` (`EmployeeNode` or `None`): Points to the employee's right report.

### `TeamTree` Class
Manages the full team reporting structure.

**Constructor**

```python
TeamTree()
```
**Attributes**
- `root` (`EmployeeNode` or `None`): The top-most employee in the organization.

**Methods**

`insert(manager_name: str, employee_name: str, side: str) -> None`
- Recursively searches for `manager_name`.
- Adds `employee_name` as the `left` or `right` child based on the side argument.
- Prints a helpful success or error message.

`print_tree(node: EmployeeNode or None = None, level: int = 0) -> None`
- Recursively prints the current team structure from top to bottom.
- Visually indents based on hierarchy level.
- Defaults to printing from the root.
