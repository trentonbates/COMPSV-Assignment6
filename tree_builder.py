'''
 - How did the recursive insertion work?

 The recursive insertion works by searching the tree for the node with the manager name that was given,
 once it finds the correct node with the matching name, it inserts the new employee as the left or right
 child, given that it is open. If it does not find the node that matches, after searching the entire
 tree it will print out a statement saying it could not be found.

 - What challenges did you face when finding the right spot for a new employee?

 Some challenges that were faced were making sure the manager was in the tree, checking if a matching nodes
 children nodes were available, handling an empty tree without any root inserted, and managing consistent
 input on the left and right sides. 

 - When might trees be preferable to other data structures in real-world systems?

 Trees are preferable to other data structures when one is wanting to represent heirarchical data.
